Speaker A: Hey, have you had lunch yet?
Speaker B: Um, not really. I was thinking of grabbing something soon.
Speaker A: Nice, I was actually going to try that new sandwich place down the street.
Speaker B: Oh yeah, I’ve heard it’s pretty good, like really fresh stuff.
Speaker A: Exactly! I figured I’d give it a shot—heard they have veggie options too.
Speaker B: That sounds perfect. You know I’ve been trying to eat healthier lately.
Speaker A: Totally! What time are you free to go?
    Speaker B: Probably around one. I just need to finish this email first.
Speaker A: Cool, I’ll wait for you in the lobby then.


Speaker B: Thanks! By the way, did you see the weather forecast for tomorrow?
Speaker A: Yeah, it's supposed to rain again—can you believe it?
Speaker B: Seriously, it’s been raining like every single day this week.
Speaker A: I miss the sun already. It just makes me so tired.
Speaker B: Same here. Maybe next week will be better, hopefully.
    Speaker A: Fingers crossed! Alright, I’ll meet you downstairs later.
Speaker B: Sounds good—see you then!
